        The air is thick with tension, like the heavy strum of a guitar echoing in a dimly lit room. Sang Zhi’s world is a whirlwind of textbooks, sleepless nights, and the haunting presence of *him*—Duan Jia Xu. Her brother’s best friend. Her secret obsession. The one who’s always been just out of reach.  
        
        Now, on the gritty campus of her new university, their paths collide like a crashing chorus. His smoldering gaze cuts through her defenses, and every accidental brush of his hand feels like a spark in the dark. But this isn’t some sweet, innocent love story—it’s raw, messy, and electric. It’s the kind of love that makes you scream into your pillow and write angsty poetry at 2 a.m.  
        
        As the days blur into nights, their connection deepens, fueled by stolen moments and whispered secrets. But with every step closer, the shadows of their past loom larger. Can they escape the weight of expectations, or will their love burn too bright and crash like a broken chord? This season, hearts will race, boundaries will shatter, and love will feel like a double-edged knife.  
        
        *Cue the heavy bassline and let the chaos begin.* 🖤
